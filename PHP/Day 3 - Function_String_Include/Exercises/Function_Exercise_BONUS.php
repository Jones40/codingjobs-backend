We have an array of integers, positive, between 1 and $nbElements (nbElements is the number of elements. You can use this variable).

Examples :

	Write a function call 'TicTac'.
	For each number 'n' of the list, we want the following operations:
		. if the number is divisible by 3 : display 'Tic'
		. if the number is divisible by 5 : display 'Tac'
		. if the number is divisible by 3 AND by 5 : display 'TicTac'
		. else : display the number 'n'
